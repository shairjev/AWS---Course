1. Update the System

Always start by ensuring your package list is current.
Bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

2. Install Apache (The Web Server)

Install Apache and enable it to start on boot.
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2

Verify: Open your browser and type in your EC2's Public IP. You should see the "Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page."

3. Install MySQL (The Database)

Install the database server and run the security script to set a root password and remove insecure defaults.
sudo apt install mysql-server -y

4. Install PHP (The Processor)

Install PHP along with the modules that allow it to talk to Apache and MySQL.
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y

To check the version installed, run php -v.

5. Testing & Permissions

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

Create a small test file in the web root to confirm Apache can handle PHP.

Verify: Visit http://your-public-ip/info.php. You should see a page detailing your PHP configuration.
Security Tip: Delete this file once you're done testing, as it reveals sensitive server info: sudo rm /var/www/html/info.php.

6. Set Directory Permissions

By default, the /var/www/html folder is owned by root. To allow your ubuntu user to upload files easily:
Bash

sudo chown -R ubuntu:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/html
